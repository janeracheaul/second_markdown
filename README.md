- I am a student who majors in Biochemistry in San Francisco. I'm now in my **2nd** year of college. I do not have any experience in coding previously but I do have a lot of friends whose major is Computer Science so I have heard about a few coding languages. My hobbies are reading books and watching movies. I'm currently watching Nomadland - an Indie movie that just won the best picture at THE GOLDEN GLOBE 2021.

- I don't have any experience in coding before therefore I am a complete _beginner_.
  I have been interested in computer science for a while and I think this time is the right time to actually pick up a **_hardskill_**. One thing that I'm afraid of about the course is that I might not be able to keep up with fast-pace of learning here. It usually takes me a while to get cliked with a new information so I'm more of a slow learner.
